MediaMath has created an open source project built on top of Web Components & Polymer called Strand. It was created for their internal web product Terminal One but is available and easy to get on Github. Daniel Lasky, Justin Moore, & Anthony Koerber chat with us about the pains of migrating from Polymer 0.5 to 1.0 as well as what it has been like to drive an open source Web Components library with Polymer Elements ranging from basic buttons to complex grids. Check out Strand’s documentation for further detail
